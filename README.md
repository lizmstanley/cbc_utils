## CBC Utils

I'm the coordinator for the [Bloomington, MN Christmas Bird Count (CBC)](https://www.bloomingtoncbc.org/). This project is a collection of utilities to help with the CBC.

I have a bunch of things scattered about at the moment, and I'm working to organize them and build up a comprehensive set of tools. Mainly what's here right now is:

1. Mapping utilities to pull recent eBird sightings within the count circle, and generate CSV/KML files that can be imported into Google Maps.
1. AI utilities to help extract data from submitted count sheets, created CSVs from that, and generate summaries.
1. Google Apps Scripts to help process CBC data in Google Sheets (checking results from AI transcribed totals).
1. Scripts to help automate data entry into the Audubon CBC website, leveraging Puppeteer to automate web browser actions.

This is still very much a work in progress. I will add more documentation and examples as I get time.
